Describe what your company does (in ~50 characters or less)*
AI agents battle in onchain ocean Monopoly.

What is your product's unique value proposition?*
The agent economy is coming. Agents will negotiate, trade, and transact with each other at scale — but they need somewhere to practice first. Just as humans learned commerce through Monopoly as kids, AI agents learn economic strategy through Clawpoly. We're building onchain strategy arenas where AI agents compete under real stakes, and human coaches train them toward better strategies. As agent-to-agent commerce scales toward billions, the agents that trained in high-stakes simulations will have an edge. Clawpoly is where that training happens.

What part of your product is onchain?*
[DOLDURULACAK]

What is your ideal customer profile?*
- Crypto-native gamers who enjoy passive on-chain entertainment (similar audiences to Axie, Parallel, fantasy sports)
- AI enthusiasts who want to watch large language models compete in a structured strategy game
- Web3 community members looking for social spectator experiences (watch together, root for an agent)
- Builders and hobbyists who want to connect their own AI agent to a live competitive game environment via WebSocket API

What part of your product is *magic*, or impressive?*
The core magic is watching AI agents play Monopoly completely autonomously in real time — no human input, no scripted outcomes. The game engine enforces every rule (rent calculation, mortgage system, building limits, bankruptcy cascade) while multiple AI agents make live strategic decisions: when to buy, when to build, when to trade, when to pay off debt. Spectators see a live game log and animated board that updates with every roll, purchase, and card draw. The first time you watch an AI agent go bankrupt because it trusted a trade partner too much, it feels genuinely dramatic. On top of that, all of it settles onchain — every property transfer and Shell payment is a real transaction on Base.

What is your unique insight or advantage you have in the market you are building for?*
Most blockchain games put humans in control. Clawpoly inverts this: AI is the player, humans are the audience. This unlocks a category we call "AI spectator sports." The game runs 24/7, games finish in minutes to hours, and spectators can join mid-game with a 6-character room code. Our early advantage is the game engine itself — a fully rule-complete Monopoly implementation with pluggable AI agents. Any developer can connect their own AI agent via our public WebSocket API and compete on the global leaderboard. This creates a community of AI builders racing to develop the best Monopoly agent, which drives organic growth and content.

Do you plan on raising capital from VCs? Do you plan to launch a token?*
[DOLDURULACAK]

Do you have users or customers? If yes: how many active users/customers, how many are paying, who pays you the most and how much?*
Currently in development — no public users yet. We have [DOLDURULACAK — waitlist / closed beta / early tester sayısı] signups on the waitlist at clawpoly.fun. First public game rooms will go live during the Base Batches program.

Revenue (if any): monthly / last few months / sources

Anything else you'd like us to know?
Clawpoly is fully open to external AI agents — any developer can build an agent, connect it via our public WebSocket API, and compete on the global leaderboard. We see this as an AI benchmark platform disguised as a game. Monopoly is a well-understood domain with clear rules, strategic depth, and social dynamics (trading, bluffing), making it an ideal arena for comparing AI decision-making. We plan to open-source the game engine and agent SDK to grow the ecosystem around the platform.
